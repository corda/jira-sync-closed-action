# jira-sync-closed-action

## Requirements

This action step requires the first issue comment to be a linking one between github and jira issues, 
in the format of "Automatically created Jira issue: XXX-YY"

## Input

The plugin takes the following arguments as input:
- token (a github token with write access to the github repo of interest)
- owner (the owner of the repository)
- repository (the name of the repository)
- jiraBaseUrl (the base url for the jira project)
- project (the jira project)
- jiraEmail (the email of the jira account to use, which needs to have read access to the project)
- jiraToken (an access token of the jira account to use)

## Usage

It is recommended to add this action step in an action workflow triggered by cron in periodic intervals.

The action, once triggered with the expected arguments, will lookup all github issues and will find the related
jira issues based on the expected first comment on them.

Then, it will lookup jira for status, finding all the closed ones in the jira board.

Lastly, api calls to github are made to update the status of the issues, closing the ones that are also closed in jira.

This plugin does not handle reopening tickets from jira, and only works one way (github assignments will not affect jira).
